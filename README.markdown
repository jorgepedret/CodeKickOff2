Code Kick Off lets you choose and integrate technologies like HTML5 boilerplate, Compass, different CSS grid frameworks & Wordpress, to start new web projects faster.

There are tons of new cool technologies out there that are helping us develop faster & faster. Code Kick Off goes one step further by integrating all these technologies in one place.

CodeKickOff lets you enter your projectâ€™s settings and choose the technologies you work with. Code Kick Off will create a .zip file with a set of files ready to be deployed immediately.

<small>Please note that CodeKickOff was literaly a weekend project, so the code is far from pretty. Fork me if you create a prettier version of it :-).</small>


<h2>Adding a new features</h2>

You can add your own grid system, cms, or features. Take a look at these files to start:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>/create.php</td>
		<td>Add your own options to the front-end form</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/process2.php</td>
		<td>Process the new options you added in create.php</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/resources/</td>
		<td>Add your own grid files here in an ordered maner</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Notice how through the resource files I use tags like %%general.wp.wp_head%% to pull content from one file and insert it in another. You can add your own tags if you wish.

The code is pretty much procedural (it kinda sucks) but it's very straight forward and easy to follow.
